## Swiss Fertility Prediction Shiny App

- Fertility_predict shiny app aims to determine the prediction of the standardized fertility measure in the swiss data set based on two models.

- First prediction is obtained using the linear model of the outcome variable and the Education predictor variable

- Second prediction is obtained using the linear model of the outcome variable and both the Education and Agriculture variables

-   The Shiny app consist of a main page and help file page. The main page consist of the slider input, the plots of the predictor and outcome variables and the calculated predicted fertility measure

-   The point on the plots and the calculated fertility measure is reactive to the values in the slider input

-   The help file provides background information about the app, and instructions on how to use the app.


## ShinyApp

Below is a snapshot of showing the slider inputs and one of the plots

## Sample UI Code

A sample of the UI code is seen below.
```{r UIcode, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Define UI for application that plots a model to determine Fertility prediction
shinyUI(fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Predicting Fertility from %Education & %Agriculture "),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins
    tabsetPanel(
        tabPanel("Home",
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("sliderE", "Indicate % of educated drafte", 0, 100, 
                        value=45),
            sliderInput("sliderA", "% of males whose occupation is Agriculture", 0, 100, 
                        value =60),
       
        ),
        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
            plotOutput("FertilityPlot"),
            h3("Predicted Fertility from model 1 is:"),
            textOutput("pred1"),
            h3("Predicted Fertility from model 2 is:"),
            textOutput("pred2")
        )
```


## Sample Server Code

A sample of the server code is seen below.
```{r Servercode, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

       # Define server logic required to draw prediction plots and output values 
shinyServer(function(input, output) {

        # Calculating the models
        model1<-lm(Fertility~Education, data=swiss)
        model2<-lm(Fertility~Education+Agriculture, data=swiss)

        # Calculating prediction based on slider input
        model1pred<-reactive({
            EduInput<-input$sliderE
            predict(model1, newdata=data.frame(Education = EduInput))  
        })
        model2pred<-reactive({
            EduInput<-input$sliderE
            AgricInput<-input$sliderA
            predict(model2, newdata=data.frame(Education = EduInput,
                                               Agriculture = AgricInput))  
        })
            
         #Plotting Variables using GGplot
        output$FertilityPlot <- renderPlot({
                   EduInput<-input$sliderE
                   AgricInput<-input$sliderA
                   model2<-lm(Fertility~Education+Agriculture, data=swiss)
